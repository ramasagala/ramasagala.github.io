My name is Rama. This is my n-th attempt to build my own personal website.
I plan to fill this webite with (mostly) bits and pieces about tech and code 
and perhaps some memes that I found lying around in the Internet.
By the time you read this, I'd probably have done the same.


You can find me on GitHub:
